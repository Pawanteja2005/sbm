Project Demonstration & Documentation
Abstract:
The Smart Building Management System project focuses on improving safety and operational efficiency by enabling manual detection and reporting of gas and fire leakage incidents. Unlike fully automated sensor-based solutions, this system leverages artificial intelligence (AI) and user-driven input mechanisms to assess potential hazards, provide real-time recommendations, and manage incident data securely. The final phase of the project includes integration with Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems for streamlined alert handling, reporting, and resource coordination.
This comprehensive report documents the system’s completion, covering demonstrations, technical architecture, source code, performance evaluation, and testing results. The system is designed to scale across large building infrastructures while maintaining robust data security and fast response mechanisms. Visual elements such as system flow diagrams, user interface screenshots, ERP integration schemas, and codebase excerpts are included to provide a complete understanding of the platform’s design and functionality.
By combining AI with manual data entry, the Smart Building Management System delivers a practical and cost-effective approach to gas and fire safety in environments where sensor automation is not feasible.

1.	Project Demonstration Overview
The Smart Building Management System for gas and fire leakage detection will be demonstrated to stakeholders, showcasing its core features, manual input process, IoT-based data transmission, and system scalability. The demonstration highlights how the platform enables efficient incident reporting, real-time alerts, and secure integration with ERP systems for centralized safety management.
Demonstration Details:
•	System Walkthrough:
A live walkthrough will illustrate the full process—from manually reporting a gas or fire incident using the web or mobile interface, to real-time alert generation and logging into the ERP system via IoT communication modules. Stakeholders will see the full data flow and system response.
•	Manual Incident Reporting:
The demonstration will show how users, such as building occupants or staff, can enter details of a gas or fire leak using intuitive forms. Fields such as incident type, location, severity, and time of detection will be manually input by the user.
•	IoT Integration:
Although the system uses manual input, IoT devices or gateways are used to transmit incident data across the network to centralized servers or ERP systems. The demonstration will show real-time data flow using IoT communication protocols such as MQTT or HTTP over secure channels.
•	Performance Metrics:
System performance will be evaluated under conditions simulating multiple concurrent reports. Metrics such as response time, data transmission speed, and system uptime will be presented to highlight reliability and scalability.
•	Security & Privacy:
The demonstration will include encryption of transmitted data, secure user authentication, and access control features to ensure that sensitive building and incident data is protected throughout the reporting and logging process.
Outcome:
By the end of the demonstration, stakeholders will see how the system effectively manages manually reported gas and fire leak incidents, transmits data securely using IoT frameworks, logs critical events into ERP systems, and scales reliably for large building environments.
